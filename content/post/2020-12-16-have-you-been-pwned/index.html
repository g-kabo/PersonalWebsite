<p>To “pwn” someone means that you have effectively overpowered or dominated that individual. It used to be most commonly used when someone was beaten in a video game, but now it refers to when a nefarious cyber-attack has occurred and someone has had their personal information stolen.</p>
<p>Recently, there was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55363828">news</a> of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_federal_government_data_breach">major cyber-attack</a> on several US federal government agencies. Known as the ‘Sunburst Breach’, it attacked various organisations by going through a supply chain, which in this case was a network management and monitoring tool from the company Solarwinds which has over 300,000 public and private customers. The attackers were able to gain access to private emails and other sensitive documents. This affected over 18,000 customers, some of which include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The US Treasury Department</p></li>
<li><p>The US Department of Homeland Security</p></li>
<li><p>The US Department of State</p></li>
<li><p>The US Department of Energy</p></li>
<li><p>Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency</p></li>
<li><p>Microsoft</p></li>
<li><p>And many more…</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is one of many cyber-attacks that have occurred in recent years. As we live in an increasingly technological world, there will be an increasing number of vulnerabilities that malicious actors would wish to exploit; this can have a huge negative impact on not only on enterprises but to ordinary people as well, as important and sensitive information can be used by the attackers for their own benefit.</p>
<p>So we will investigate the questions of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>What type of information is being stolen?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>How has the number of data breaches changed over time?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>What were the scales of breaches, and did they also change over time?</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will use the site <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">haveibeenpwned</a> to answers these questions. This is a site that contains a list of all emails and passwords that have been compromised from a confirmed data breach, and users are able to input either an email address or password to find out if that information has been leaked.</p>
<p>The site is not an exhaustive list of all breaches that have happened as there are many that are undetected or unannounced, but the site does contain the subset of publicly announced breaches. To learn more about the site, you can visit the <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/FAQs">FAQs</a> section of the site.</p>
<div id="the-data" class="section level1">
<h1>The data</h1>
<p>These are the libraries I will use in R</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(ggtext)
library(wordcloud2)
#loadfonts(device = &quot;win&quot;)

options(kableExtra.html.bsTable = TRUE) #Allows the use of nice looking tables for kable</code></pre>
<p>Here I use the API to obtain the data, the site also contains information on the attributes in the provided <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2#BreachModel">data dicitionary</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>url &lt;-  &quot;https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v2/breaches&quot;

raw_result  &lt;- httr::GET(url)

data_breaches &lt;- httr::content(raw_result, as = &quot;text&quot;) %&gt;%
  jsonlite::fromJSON()

data_breach &lt;-  data_breaches %&gt;% 
  select(-LogoPath,-Description) %&gt;%
  mutate(across(ends_with(&quot;Date&quot;), as.Date))</code></pre>
<p>We have 495 data breaches in this dataset, with 14 attributes. The attributes of most interest to us are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><code>name</code></strong> and <strong><code>title</code></strong> - refers to the source of the data breach.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>BreachDate</code></strong> - refers to the date the breach occurred, it should be noted that breaches are frequently discovered after some time has passed since the initial breach has occurred.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>PwnCount</code></strong> - the number of accounts affected in a data breach.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>DataClasses</code></strong> - contains a list of the type of data stolen, this can include types like e-mails and passwords.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>IsVerified</code></strong> - if the breach has been deemed legitimate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>IsFabricated</code></strong> - if the breach contains lots of fake date.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>IsSensitive</code></strong> - if the breach contains information on a user that can have adverse reaction if they were discovered to be on the site. An example of a site that had a sensitive data breach is Ashley Madison - an online dating service for people in relationships or marriages. Here emails, names, home addresses, credit card information and other personal identifiable information was leaked.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>IsSpamList</code></strong> - if the breach contains large amounts of personnel identifiable information used for the purpose of targeting spam.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>IsRetired</code></strong> - a breach permanently deleted from the site. But there is only one instance of this in the dataset, so we won’t be worrying about this attribute.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We can count up the boolean attributes to get an idea of what type of breaches have occurred.</p>

<p>From table <a href="#tab:table1">2</a>, we see that the most recent hack was the Cit0day hack which contained nearly 227 million e-mail addresses and passwords. Other recent leaks such as the Wongnai leak contained information such as geographic locations, IP addresses, phone numbers, and social media profiles.</p>

<h1>What type of information is being stolen?</h1>
<p>It is clear that a wide variety of information is being leaked, but is it possible to know what data is being leaked and which is the most common? From the data provided, the answer is yes!</p>
<p>We will obtain list of the types of stolen data. We see examples such as: Email addresses, IP addresses, names, password phone numbers, physical addresses, credit cards, biometric data to more spurious data such as eating habits, sexual fetishes, and astrological signs.</p>

<p>Of these we see that email addresses, IP addresses, and phone numbers have seen a declining trend since 2016, while passwords, names, and physical addresses have seen an increase from 2015.</p>

<p>The above graph shows the trend of the 5 most leaked data types in 2020 and shows their trends. We see that in 2019, a staggering 2.5 billion email addresses were leaked. That means that if all 7.8 billion people in the world had an email address, 32% of them would have been leaked. However, it is extremely likely that there are many duplicated leaks, an example is many people using the common password of <code>password</code>. This is one of the most common passwords used<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and so would be “repeated” many times in the dataset, this holds true for other data types.</p>

<p>From 2007 to 2010, data breaches were infrequent, and the largest breach affected just under 400 million accounts. It is plausible that since this was during the early part of the data collection, there could be many missing breaches. We wouldn’t be able to fully know how many there were during this time, but at least we have some data to point to.</p>
<p>After 2010, we start seeing breaches of increasing frequency and scale. Around 2017, there are several breaches that number over 400 million affected accounts.</p>
<p>we can also display this scatter plot using a log scale, this will also us to discern what is going on for very small values of <code>PwnCount</code> - as we have truly huge numbers on the scale of <span class="math inline">\(10^7\)</span></p>

</div>
<p>Notice how we can tell how the distribution changed over time, we see more “small-scale” and “large-scale” breaches as time goes by. The low-scale hacks seem to be of the order of <span class="math inline">\(\exp(7) \approx 10^3\)</span>, while large scale hacks are on the order of <span class="math inline">\(\exp(20)\approx 10^{8}\)</span>. So, we have a wide range of accounts affected, from as low as thousands to as high as hundreds of millions.</p>

<h1>What else can we find out?</h1>
<p>There are lots more we could find out more specifically by diving deeper into the dataset, but we will finish by looking at when breaches were reported, namely, we will look at the day and month of reported breach date.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data_breach %&gt;%

<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We see that Monday and Thursday are the days with the most reported breaches, while Saturday is the least common - this shouldn’t be too surprising as Saturday is a weekend. But Sunday, also a weekend, has the third highest number of reported breaches.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data_breach %&gt;% 
  mutate( month =  lubridate::month(BreachDate,label=TRUE)) %&gt;% 
  group_by(month) %&gt;%

<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We see that early Summer is when most breaches are reported generally speaking, but it also appears that the Winder season is also common too. The Summer spike could be explained by individuals being lax or unavailable as it is the Summer holidays, and the Winter spike could be explained by the fact that there are many holiday events taking place or being in the festive spirit.</p>

<p>It is evident that the first day of the year is the day where most breaches are reported, though why this is the case I’m not entirely sure.</p>
<p>Sometimes bad news gets dumped on days when a major story has broken or people are busy focusing on something else, this way the bad news does not get as much attention as it normally would on an “ordinary” day. This is slightly cynical, but perhaps announcing hacks on New Year’s Day follows this trend? But this doesn’t explain why lots of reports of breaches are reported on the first day of a month.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Let’s look back at the questions asked earlier and answer them here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What type of information is being stolen?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The five most common types of information stolen are: emails addresses, passwords, usernames, IP addresses, and personal names.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How has the number of data breaches changed over time?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>From 2007 onwards, there has been a gradual increase in the number of breaches affecting at least 1,000 people.
From just one breach in 2007, to 48 in 2020, with a peak of 90 in 2016.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What were the scales of breaches, and did they also change over time?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Typically the smallest breaches affects thousands of people, while the largest affects hundreds of millions. From simply viewing the data on figure <a href="#fig:plotboxlog">3</a>, there does not appear to be any change in the average scale of breaches over time.</p>
<div id="final-thoughts" class="section level2">
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>This ends our look into the data of data breaches. As stressed earlier, the data does not cover every breach that has ever happened. There could be many breaches that have happened that occurred on a massive scale and breadth that has not been publicly disclosed.</p>
<p>From my understanding of the data, it doesn’t seem to include data breaches or cyber-attacks conducted by state level actors; the scale of attacks committed at this level could be extremely high.</p>
<p>In any case, I personally don’t think we’ll ever know the true scale of all data breaches committed.</p>
