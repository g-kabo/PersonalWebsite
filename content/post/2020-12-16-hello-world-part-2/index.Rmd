**UPDATE**: This is a test to see if the page will dynamically update the code chunks


```{r}
Sys.time()
runif(1)
```


<p align='center'>
<img src="/images/sun-rise.jpg" width="800" height="400">
</p>


This works! We can also customise easily it's dimensions



The image below also works, but it does not display on the creation side. Replacing the "/images/..." with "/static/images/..." renders on on creation side but not production side.

Example:

* This does not render on creation side, but does on production

![cool sunrise](/images/sun-rise.jpg)


* Whereas this does render creations side, but does not for productions.


![cool sunrise](/static/images/sun-rise.jpg)


START CODE IMAGE

```{r sunrise, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
#knitr::include_graphics("images/sun-rise.jpg", error=FALSE)
knitr::include_graphics("/images/sun-rise.jpg", error=FALSE)
```




END CODE IMAGE


Tweet shortcode


```{r echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode('tweet', '852205086956818432')
```
