Hello World!

This will be a blog where I will post things mainly related to data. This may be analysis of data that I find interesting or it may be on something current. There is also the chance that I post things that are completely unrelated to data.

I am writing this blog as a way of documenting my work and being able to easily collate everything into one place; this will mean that it will be easy for me or anyone else to follow my work.

I don't know where this blog will take me, but I am sure it will be a fun journey.
