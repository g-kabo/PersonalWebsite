<p>Hello World!</p>
<p>This will be a blog where I will post things mainly related to data. This may be analysis of data that I find interesting or it may be on something current. There is also the chance that I post things that are completely unrelated to data.</p>
<p>I am writing this blog as a way of documenting my work and being able to easily collate everything into one place; this will mean that it will be easy for me or anyone else to follow my work.</p>
<p>I donâ€™t know where this blog will take me, but I am sure it will be a fun journey.</p>
